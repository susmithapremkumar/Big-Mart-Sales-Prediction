# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
Internship for Ineuron

# Problem Statement :
Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.

# Approach :
The main goal is to build a model to predict the BigMart outlet sales based on different factors available in the dataset.

# Data Collection : 
The dataset was downloaded from the Kaggle.
